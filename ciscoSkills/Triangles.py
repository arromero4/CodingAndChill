Sample functions: Triangles
Let's play with triangles now. We'll start with a function to check whether three sides of given lengths can build a triangle.

We know from school that the sum of two arbitrary sides has to be longer than the third side.

It won't be a hard challenge. The function will have three parameters â€’ one for each side.

It will return True if the sides can build a triangle, and False otherwise. In this case, is_a_triangle is a good name for such a function.

Look at the code in the editor. You can find our function there. Run the program.
