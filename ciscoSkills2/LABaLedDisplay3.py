LAB   A LED Display
You've surely seen a seven-segment display.

It's a device (sometimes electronic, sometimes mechanical) designed to present one decimal digit using a subset of seven segments. If you still don't know what it is, refer to the following Wikipedia article.

Your task is to write a program which is able to simulate the work of a seven-display device, although you're going to use single LEDs instead of segments.

Each digit is constructed from 13 LEDs (some lit, some dark, of course) – that's how we imagine it:

  # ### ### # # ### ### ### ### ### ###
  #   #   # # # #   #     # # # # # # # 
  # ### ### ### ### ###   # ### ### # # 
  # #     #   #   # # #   # # #   # # # 
  # ### ###   # ### ###   # ### ### ###
Note: the number 8 shows all the LED lights on.

Your code has to display any non-negative integer number entered by the user.

Tip: using a list containing patterns of all ten digits may be very helpful.
